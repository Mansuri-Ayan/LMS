## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend**:

  * Next.js
  * TypeScript
  * EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)

* **Backend**:

  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * MongoDB

* **Authentication**:

  * JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

* **Styling**:

  * Tailwind CSS

## 📂 Project Structure

* `client/`: Contains the frontend application built with Next.js and TypeScript.
* `server/`: Houses the backend API developed using Node.js and Express.js.
* `models/`: Defines the MongoDB schemas for the application.
* `routes/`: Contains the Express.js route handlers.
* `controllers/`: Implements the business logic for each route.
* `middleware/`: Includes middleware functions for authentication and error handling.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mansuri-Ayan/LMS.git
   cd LMS
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:

   ```bash
   # For the server
   cd server
   npm install

   # For the client
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
   * Add your MongoDB URI and JWT secret key:

     ```
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

4. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Start the server
   cd server
   npm run dev

   # In a new terminal, start the client
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📌 Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
* **Course Management**: Create, update, and delete courses.
* **Enrollment System**: Students can enroll in available courses.
* **Progress Tracking**: Monitor student progress through courses.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for seamless access on all devices.
